# Graph Implementation (Python & Ruby) üìà

This repository comprises a basic implementation of a non-weighted graph structure in Python and Ruby, providing essential functionalities for graph operations.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Graph Implementation**: Includes essential functionalities for a non-weighted graph in both Python and Ruby.
- **Top Companies Visualization**: A script to display the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their top 5 owners in an interactive graph using a GUI. The graph's visual aspects, such as node and edge sizes, are scaled based on ownership percentages compared to stocks and other owners.

## Contents üì¶
