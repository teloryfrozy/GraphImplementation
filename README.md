# Graph Implementation (Python & Ruby) üìà

Welcome to the Graph Implementation repository! üöÄ

This repository contains a basic implementation of a non-weighted graph structure in Python and Ruby, providing a fundamental framework for graph operations.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Graph Implementation**: Includes essential functionalities for a non-weighted graph in both Python and Ruby.
- **Top Companies Visualization**: A script to display the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their top 5 owners in an interactive graph using a GUI. The graph's visual aspects, such as node and edge sizes, are scaled based on ownership percentages compared to stocks and other owners.

## Contents üì¶

- **Python Implementation**: Contains a Python script for a non-weighted graph structure.
- **Ruby Implementation**: Includes a Ruby implementation of the same non-weighted graph functionalities.
- **NASDAQ100 Visualization Script**: Offers a script to visualize the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their major owners using graph visualization techniques.

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Python Implementation**:
    - Access the `python_graph` directory to explore the Python implementation.
    - Utilize the functionalities provided to construct and manipulate non-weighted graphs.

2. **Ruby Implementation**:
    - Navigate to the `ruby_graph` directory to delve into the Ruby implementation.
    - Use the provided methods to perform various graph operations in Ruby.

3. **NASDAQ100 Visualization**:
    - Run the provided script to visualize the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their top 5 owners in an interactive graph.
    - Customize the displayed information and adjust graph visualizations based on your preferences.

## How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Python Graph**:
    - Execute the Python scripts in the `python_graph` directory using your Python interpreter.

2. **Ruby Graph**:
    - Run the Ruby scripts provided in the `ruby_graph` directory using your Ruby interpreter.

3. **NASDAQ100 Visualization**:
    - Run the visualization script for NASDAQ100 companies using the provided instructions in the respective directory.
