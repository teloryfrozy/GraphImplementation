# Graph Implementation (Python & Ruby) ðŸ“ˆ

This repository comprises a basic implementation of a non-weighted graph structure in Python and Ruby, providing essential functionalities for graph operations.

## Features âœ¨

- **Graph Implementation**: Includes essential functionalities for a non-weighted graph in both Python and Ruby.
- **Top Companies Visualization**: A script to display the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their top 5 owners in an interactive graph using a GUI. The graph's visual aspects, such as node and edge sizes, are scaled based on ownership percentages compared to stocks and other owners.

## Contents ðŸ“¦

- **Python Implementation**: Contains a Python script for a non-weighted graph structure.
- **Ruby Implementation**: Includes a Ruby implementation of the same non-weighted graph functionalities.
- **NASDAQ100 Visualization Script**: Offers a script to visualize the top companies of NASDAQ100 and their major owners using graph visualization techniques.
